# TrackFace
It tracks the position of your face while driving so you can keep your face straight and watch on the road. If you get distracted while driving and your face moves somewhere else it generates an alarm and displays a warning sign.
It uses MATLAB which takes input from the webcam and comminicates with Arduino using MATLAB to Arduino Serial Communication.
